# Bowling Windows Form App
Welcome to the Bowling Windows Form App! 
This is a computer graphic project made in Windows forms in C# .NET using OpenGL

# What's in the project?
It's a simulation of a bowling game, a bowling field with ball and pins.

# OpenGL usages:
The projects uses matrixes to create the enviroment that you are seeing!
you have the abillity to move the camera placments in all directions and you can even move the lighting source to anywhere you want!
the shining bowling's lane allows you to see the reflections of the ball and the pins
and if you change mode you can change the whole enviroment into a bowling game on a road, throwing wheel instead of a ball, and instead of reflection you will see the shadows.
there is a button to "cleanup" the field which will simulate the pins cleanup, displaying beautiful animation of the mechanics behind the cleanup machine.
there are 2 special buttons for cool effects:
1. the ripple effect, the enviroment will change, and now everything is on water and you will be able to see the ripple effect under the ball, you can even increase and decrease this effect.
2. fire effect, you can set the ball on fire!, the ball will start to emmit fire particles and will act as the light source of the screen, you can throw the ball and see how the fire follows it.
